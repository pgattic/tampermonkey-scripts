# Tampermonkey Scripts

My custom scripts for Chrome's Tampermonkey extension. I mainly maintain this for personal use, but anyone can feel free to copy or use them if they'd like. If any code is used as part of another project, I'd prefer credit to go to me if possible. Thanks!

Note: I prefer to use Violentmonkey instead of Tampermonkey, and I include in this repository an exported archive of all of the scripts, which can be easily imported into Violentmonkey (and related tools, I believe) all together.
